				<h1 class="title is-4">Short version</h1>

				<div class="block">
					We don't like cookie banners (they are useless and misleading). We don't want to bloat our
					site with them and compromise your experience. <strong>But</strong>
					we would like to have
					<em>some</em>
					idea of how many people are visiting OTel recipes.
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					For that, we decided to use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a>
					- a privacy-friendly web analytics alternative to Google Analytics. This way we all win.
					<strong>We</strong>
					have some idea of the traffic and things we can use to improve OTel recipes, and
					<strong>you</strong>
					don't have to be nagged with cookie banners or worry about being tracked online.
				</div>

				<h1 class="title is-4">Long version</h1>

				<div class="block">
					This page explains what visiting and using OTel recipes means for your online privacy.
					First and foremost, privacy is something <strong>very important to us</strong>
					, and it is at the core of everything we build here. OTel recipes will never have ads or resort
					to any sort of nasty business. It is
					<strong>not</strong>
					in our interest to track you online or make money with the site.
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					I'm sure you despise what the "web" of today has become. Annoying, distracting and
					misleading cookie/consent banners all over the place, newsletter popups, intrusive
					advertisements, you name it. We are set in <strong>not making</strong>
					OTel recipes part of this bad experience.
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					Following this principle makes it really hard to have/rely on web analytics
					though. "Free" tools such as Google Analytics uses all sort of bad practices to track users
					online and, in some countries, is even illegal due to data privacy laws (e.g. GDPR).
					Using such services would require us to hire a lawyer and draft a long privacy notice and
					put those annoying cookie banners, otherwise we could run into legal troubles.
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					Nevertheless, for us, the creators of OTel recipes, it is still valuable to have some web
					analytics on the site. It gives us insights on things like: What is the most searched
					programming language; What is the most used OpenTelemetry signal; Which browsers are being
					used; Which screen size etc. It helps us know that our work matters, that people out there
					are using it and how can we make the site better.
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					There are several "privacy-friendly" alternatives to Google Analytics. In the next
					section, you can find out the tool we use and how your data is handled.

				<h1 class="title is-4">Web analytics with GoatCounter</h1>

				<div class="block">
					After some research, we settled to use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">
						GoatCounter
					</a>
					. It's also an open source project, and its principles around online privacy aligns well with
					the ones we invision for OTel recipes. According to their website:
				</div>

				<div class="content">
					<blockquote>
						GoatCounter aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics as
						an alternative to Google Analytics or Matomo
					</blockquote>
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					Regarding what GoatCounter uses for web analytics, their <a
						href="https://trinity.goatcounter.com/help/privacy"
					>
						privacy policy
					</a>
					states:
				</div>

				<div class="content">
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The following information can be collected:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>URL of the visited page.</li>
							<li>Referer header</li>
							<li>User-Agent header</li>
							<li>Screen size</li>
							<li>Country and region name based on IP address</li>
							<li>A hash of the IP address, User-Agent, and random number</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP address,
							User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory for 8 hours to
							identify a browsing session, and is never stored to disk.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
				</div>

				<h1 class="title is-5">GDPR consent notices</h1>

				<div class="block">
					The reason why we don't have a consent banner on OTel recipes is because GoatCounter
					<em>possibly</em>
					doesn't require one, since no personally identifiable information is collected:
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<blockquote>
						The short version is that GoatCounter probably doesn’t require a GDPR consent notice, on
						the basis that 1) no personally identifiable information is collected, and 2) it is in
						the legitimate interest of a site’s owner to see how many people are visiting their
						site.
					</blockquote>
				</div>
				<div class="block">

						href="https://trinity.goatcounter.com/help/gdpr"

						GDPR consent notices
					</a>
					page.
