Welcome to OTel recipes!

For many, observability is a whole new world and getting started can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning.

OTel recipes is an open source project that aims to help users get started with OpenTelemetry
*the easy way*.

With the help of simple, to-the-point sample applications and well-defined steps (just like a recipe!)
users can learn OpenTelemetry concepts and apply them on their applications.

In a nutshell, OTel recipes is composed of two parts: the collection of sample
applications that are focused on achieving a specific goal with OpenTelemetry and
[the website](https://otelrecipes.com), that allows you to browse the samples
in a simple and structured way.

## Contributing

The goal of OTel recipes is to help users get started with it, which can't
happen without sample applications ðŸ˜….

Contributions are very much welcome, and we tried to make the process of contributing
to OTel recipes as easy as possible.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to get started. Feel free to start a discussion
or open an issue if you get stuck or if something is unclear along the way.
